# Hello

My name is Saif. I'm an accomplished product leader, quantitative platform developer, and ML practitioner who has consistently tackled tough, real-life problems and successfully delivered lasting platforms and solutions.

I'm especially good at balancing ground-level efforts with user interaction, stakeholder management, and organizational savvy to help deliver solutions which will be accepted and flourish in difficult enterprise settings. I have significant professional experience leading major strategic initiatives with complex quantitative/analytical components. I prefer being hands-on at least part of the time â€“ analyzing data, prototyping solutions and working with teams on-the-ground.

Having done both Platform and Partner Engineering for over a decade, I bring deep ground-level experience instead of just applying theoretical enterprise architecture. Everything from evaluating components for correctness to facing Regulators to defend firm interests. My past work lives on -- at stock exchanges, global clearing facilities, banks, hedge funds, hospitals, and at US defense+intelligence facilities.
